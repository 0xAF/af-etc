Some files and scripts I put on newly installed systems.

### usage

Instead of running the init script below you should sneak into the configs and copy what you like ...

*Use at your own risk!! this will overwrite your current zsh, ssh, vim and git config.*

    wget https://raw.github.com/0xAF/af-etc/master/init/init.sh && chmod a+x init.sh

### acknowledgement

I've dropped my install method and used some stuff from https://github.com/seebi/rc
