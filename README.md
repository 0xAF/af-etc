Some files and scripts I put on newly installed systems.

### usage

You should probably have a look at the scripts and config files and pickup only what you need/want.

*Use at your own risk!! this will overwrite some of your configurations.*

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/0xAF/af-etc/master/init.sh && chmod +x init.sh

### acknowledgement

I've used some ideas from https://github.com/seebi/rc. Mainly the Makefile idea.
